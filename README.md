# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my personal solutions to Harvard University's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) problem sets and projects. It is intended as a record of my progress throughout the course and as a portfolio of the skills I developed while learning computer science fundamentals.

**Note**: Please do not copy these solutions directly for your own submissions. They are shared for reference and personal use only.

## Structure

### pset_0/

- [project.sb3](pset_0/project.sb3) – a simple **"catch the apple"** game created in Scratch, inspired by the classic Polish cartoon ["Porwanie Baltazara Gąbki"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abduction_of_Balthazar_Sponge_(TV_series)).

### pset_1/

- [cash/cash.c](pset_1/cash/cash.c) – implements a [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) to calculate the minimum number of coins needed for change.
- [credit/credit.c](pset_1/credit/credit.c) – implements the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
- [mario-less/mario.c](pset_1/mario-less/mario.c) – prints a pyramid of hashes (#).
- [mario-more/mario.c](pset_1/mario-more/mario.c) – prints a pyramid of hashes (#), slightly harder.
- [me/hello.c](pset_1/me/hello.c) – a *"hello, world"* program with name input.
- [world/hello.c](pset_1/world/hello.c) – a simple *"hello, world"* program.

### pset_2/

- [caesar/caesar.c](pset_2/caesar/caesar.c) - implements the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- [readability/readability.c](pset_2/readability/readability.c) – calculates the [Coleman-Liau index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index) to estimate the reading level of a given text.
- [scrabble/scrabble.c](pset_2/scrabble/scrabble.c) - a simple game of [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble), comparing two players' scores.
