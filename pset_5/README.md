## How to run

All programs in this set are written in **C**. You will need a compiler (e.g., `clang` or `gcc`) and the `make` tool to run them.
If you're using the [CS50 IDE](cs50.dev), everything is preinstalled.

1.  **Compile**: To compile a program, use the `make` command followed by the filename without the `.c` extension. This command will create an executable file with the same name.

    ```bash
    make <program_name>
    ```

2.  **Execute**: To run the compiled program, type `./` followed by its name.

    ```bash
    ./<program_name>
    ```

**Example:**

```bash
# Compiles the hello.c file into an executable file named hello
make hello

# Runs the program
./hello
