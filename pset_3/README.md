- `plurality/plurality.c` – [Plurality](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/3/plurality/). Runs a [plurality election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting).
- `runoff/runoff.c` – [Runoff](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/3/runoff/). Runs a [runoff election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting).
- `sort/` - [Sort](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/3/sort/). A problem where you need to decide which sorting algorithm is which based on how fast they compile.

## How to run

All programs in this set are written in **C** and require the `cs50.h` library. If you’re using the [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.dev/), everything is preinstalled.

To compile a program, use `make` followed by the filename (without `.c`). 

```bash
make example
./example
