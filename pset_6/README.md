## How to run

All programs in this set are written in **Python**. You will need a **Python 3** interpreter installed to run them.
If you're using the [CS50 IDE](cs50.dev), everything is preinstalled.

To run a script, use the `python` command followed by the full filename.

```bash
python <script_name.py>
